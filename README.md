Santa's Sleigh Ride
==================
A Christmas game for Twitch!

Requirements
============
This project uses the following IDE's and libraries when compiling:

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
+ SFML (Simple Fast Media Library)
+ a SnowForSanta.ttf font to be placed in the "Santas-Sleigh-Ride" directory.

Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 is the main IDE used in order to quickly setup the project.  SFML is used for graphics rendering and keyboard input, and SnowForSanta.ttf is the font file used to render text in the game.  Please make sure that you find a font that you can use, as it will not be distributed within this in order to prevent potential copyright issues.
